# 🎯 Express Session Random Number Game

A secure number-guessing game built with **Node.js, Express, EJS, Cookies, Sessions, and Middleware**. The server generates a random number, stores it securely using cookies and sessions, and allows authenticated users to guess the number within limited attempts.

This project demonstrates real-world backend concepts like:

* Express session management
* Cookie-based state handling
* Middleware usage
* MVC architecture
* Authentication flow (Login / Signup)
* Server-side game logic

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🔐 User Authentication (Login / Signup)
* 🧠 Server-generated random number (1–10)
* 🍪 Random number stored securely in cookies
* 📦 Attempts tracking using cookies
* 🧩 Middleware-based random number generation
* 🔁 Game reset functionality
* ❄️ Input freeze on win/lose
* 🛡️ Backend validation & game-state protection
* 🧱 MVC architecture

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

* **Node.js**
* **Express.js**
* **EJS (Template Engine)**
* **express-session**
* **Cookies**
* **Bootstrap 5**
* **MVC Architecture**

## 🧠 Core Logic

### 🔹 Random Number Middleware

`middleware/generateRandomNumber.js`

* Generates a random number between **1 and 10**
* Stores it as a cookie: `randomNumber`
* Initializes `attemptsLeft`

---

### 🔹 Session Handling

* `express-session` is used for authentication
* Session stores user email after login
* Only authenticated users can access the game

---

### 🔹 Game Rules

* User gets limited attempts
* Server compares input with random number
* Hints are provided:

  * "think of a larger number"
  * "think of a smaller number"
* Input freezes when:

  * User wins
  * Attempts become 0

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User Signup
2. User Login
3. Session created
4. Random number cookie generated
5. Game access granted

## ▶️ How to Run Locally

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Mrutunjaya-Panda/express-session-random-number-game

# Go to project folder
cd express-session-random-number-game

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start server
npm start
```

Then open in browser:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 🧪 Gameplay Flow

1. Login to system
2. Random number is generated by middleware
3. Cookie stores random number
4. User guesses number
5. Server validates
6. Attempts decrease
7. Game ends on:

   * Correct guess (WIN)
   * Attempts = 0 (LOSE)
